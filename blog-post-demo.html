                    A balanced diet is one that fulfills all of a person's nutritional needs. Humans need a certain amount of calories and nutrients to stay healthy.
                    A balanced diet provides all the nutrients a person requires, without going over the recommended daily calorie intake.
                    By eating a balanced diet, people can get the nutrients and calories they need and avoid eating junk food, or food without nutritional value.
                    The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) used to recommend following a food pyramid. However, as nutritional science has changed, they now recommend eating foods from the five groups and building a balanced plate.
                    According to the USDA's recommendations, half of a person's plate should consist of fruits and vegetables.
                    The other half should be made up of grains and protein. They recommend accompanying each meal with a serving of low-fat dairy or another source of the nutrients found in dairy.

                    <h3 class="display-4">What's the deal with grains, anyway?</h3>

                    <p>
                        There are two subgroups: whole grains and refined grains.
                        Whole grains include all three parts of the grain, which are the bran, germ, and endosperm. The body breaks down whole grains slowly, so they have less effect on a person's blood sugar.
                        Additionally, whole grains tend to contain more fiber and protein than refined grains.
                        Refined grains are processed and do not contain the three original components. Refined grains also tend to have less protein and fiber, and they can cause blood sugar spikes.
                        Grains used to form the base of the government-approved food pyramid, meaning that most of a person's daily caloric intake came from grains. However, the updated guidelines suggest that grains should make up only a quarter of a person's plate.
                        At least half of the grains that a person eats daily should be whole grains. Healthful whole grains include:
